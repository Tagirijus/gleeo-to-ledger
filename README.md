This is a little program for converting the Gleeo Timetracking data to the ledger-cli timetracking format.

# Gleeo Timetracker

This is a handy app for tracking the time in Android. It's a free app without ads (thanks fpr the dev!). More information [on their website](http://gleeo.com/index.php/de/).

# Usage

Gleeo Timetracker can export the timetracking data in CSV format. You just need to input this `*.csv` file and tite the output file and the programm will convert all the data into the ledger format. Start the program with `-h` or `--help` for more information.

# ToDo

- Maybe making the rows dynamic, instead of hard-coded.
